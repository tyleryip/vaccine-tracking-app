# Vaccine Tracking App

A vaccine tracking app, designed and implemented for our CPSC 471 - Database Management Systems course project. This app was built using the Django framework and an SQLite3 database.

## Installation

Ensure that you have a Django-compatible version of Python installed on your machine. Django 3.0 currently supports Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. For more information on Django-Python compatibility, see [Django compatibility](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.0/)

Use pip to install the required dependencies for this project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Django's base manage.py utility tool provides some built in command line commands to interact with the project. These commands must be run from the cpsc471-project directory.

To run the development server, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Since the database is local to each machine, you will need to create an admin user to be able to access to administration site. To do this, run the following command and follow the prompts to create an admin user:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Our project ships with some sample data in a csv file. To load this data, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py populate_db sampledata3.csv
```

To clear the database of all application data (models excluding admin/authentication data), run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py clear_db
```

## Features

Our application has two main features, the administration site (generated by Django) and the user site, developed by our group.

Administrators can:

- [x] view and edit any entities within the database
- [x] create additional administrators

Within the user site, we have two user types, civilian users and nurse users.

Civilian users can:

- [x] log into the system
- [x] register as a new civilian user
- [x] view their basic health information, including any health conditions
- [x] view a basic risk assessment score, based on factors such as age, occupation, location, and health conditions
- [x] view their appointments
- [ ] create new appointments
- [x] view their family doctor's information

Nurse users can:

- [x] log into the system
- [x] register as a new nurse user
- [x] view their upcoming appointments
- [x] view all available vaccines in the database
- [x] get a detailed view on a specific vaccine, including where the vaccine is stored and disposed, and if there are specific conditions for either of these actions.
- [x] view their available PPE and their supplier information
